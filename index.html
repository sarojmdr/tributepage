          <h2>King of Bhaktapur</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Bhupatindra Malla was a Malla Dynasty King of the Kingdom of Bhaktapur</strong>
            (present day Bhaktapur, Nepal) who reigned from 1696 until his death in 1722. He is the
            most widely known as king of Bhaktapur and is among the most popular of the Malla
            dynasty. He is popularly known in Bhaktapur as nepaḥ juju, meaning the king of the
            Newars. His reign was characterized by the construction of numerous palaces and temples
            with the Nyatapola temple being his most revered contribution. An integral part of the
            local folklore, Bhupatindra Malla is regarded as a great builder and a lover of arts
            whose reign is considered the cultural high point of Bhaktapur.
